## Goal
Ongoing: a Minecraft-style voxel engine (Godot 4 + C++ GDExtension) with chunked streaming, greedy meshing, colored lighting, biome-based terrain, and frustum/LOD-prioritized rendering. The frustum-prioritized loading + sharded-locking + palette-storage rework described below is complete and on `main`; this file now also tracks the rendering/content work and repo hygiene that followed it.

## Constraints & Preferences
- Bias toward minimal, high-impact changes that reuse existing infrastructure.
- Camera3D child named "Camera3D" on the player node is the frustum source.
- Chunk size is 32×32×32, world height 1024 blocks (`WORLD_HEIGHT_Y` in `chunk_coords.hpp`).
- Block properties live in `data/block_definitions.json`, not scattered across C++ — that's the single source of truth now (see below).

## Progress
### Done
**Frustum-prioritized loading, sharded locking, palette storage (foundational rework):**
- Created `core/frustum.hpp` — header-only Frustum with 6-plane extraction and AABB test.
- `DirtyChunkEntry` priority: `urgent > in_frustum > dist_sq`; `MeshQueue`/`MeshManager` reprioritize accept an optional `Frustum*`.
- `WorldUpdater` two-phase generation: dedicated frustum-priority pass first, then distance-sorted sweep. `update_unload()` defers unloading visible chunks beyond render distance.
- Dynamic mesh budget: visible-chunk ratio scales `mesh_rebuild_budget`/`upload_budget` from 0.5× (sparse) to 1.0× (full).
- Collision: binary-search AABB approach (a 3D DDA variant was tried and reverted after side-face ghosting bugs).
- **Sharded chunk map**: 64 shards, each with its own `shared_mutex` + `unordered_map`. `ShardLock`/`ExclusiveShardLock` RAII types; `lock_chunk()`, `lock_keys()`, `lock_all()` for ordered multi-shard locking. Single-chunk/block accessors lock only their own shard; batch methods lock all relevant shards in ascending order to avoid deadlock.
- **PaletteStorage** (blocks and light): 8 × 16³ paletted sections per chunk replace the old dense arrays. Uniform sections (all air, all stone) cost only a palette entry; non-uniform sections use 4/8/16-bit indices as needed. Per-chunk memory dropped from ~130KB to ~1–20KB on typical terrain.
- Renamed Mountains→StonePlateau biome across enum, block selection, and debug renderers.
- Fixed several correctness bugs found via play-testing: incorrect interior-chunk mesh culling next to non-fully-solid neighbors; a Y-index formula bug in `count_section_blocks`; stale `solid_cache` entries causing missing faces (fixed by zeroing at build start); an editor-viewport `_process` bug.
- Added translucent water as a second mesh surface with its own shader (`voxel_shader_water.gdshader`, `voxel_material_water.tres`) — edge fade, tint, shimmer, Beer-Lambert depth absorption — and wired sky/fog/player-light parameter updates to both terrain and water materials every frame.
- Micro-optimizations across the greedy mesher (single-pass vertical sweep, solid-block fast paths, `BlockID`-typed `solid_cache`, incremental AO tracking) — measured greedy_v cost dropping roughly 2.68ms → ~0.73–0.98ms and greedy_h ~0.82ms → ~0.52ms in earlier profiling on this project's dev machine.
- **Removed the old LOD system entirely**: deleted `lod_controller`, `lod_types`, `lod_mesh_builder`, `merged_mesh_builder`, `mesh_manager_lod.*` (2,435 lines) — the 2×2×2 group-mesh-merging approach, along with `CompletedGroupMesh`, `ChunkRenderLod`/`LodLevel`, and the `lod0_radius`/`lod1_radius` inspector properties.

**Rendering, terrain content, and a second LOD approach (later work — not previously logged here):**
- **Replaced the removed LOD system with a simpler, per-chunk distance-based approach**: `lod_distance` and `lod_detail_level` properties on `ChunkManager` drive stride/detail reduction directly inside the greedy mesher for far chunks, instead of merging chunks into groups. Iterated through several correctness passes: boundary footprint aliasing, corner-sampling aliasing in `solid_cache`, majority-vote (instead of first-hit) macro-cell occupancy, a stride-1 "skirt" ring at the LOD transition to prevent T-junction cracks, and a cap of 128 LOD remeshes/frame.
- Fixed a longstanding null-neighbor handling bug across the mesher: missing neighbor chunks are now treated as air for culling purposes rather than force-culling faces (this had been reintroduced/reverted at least once before landing correctly).
- Fixed a race in `cross_writer` (vegetation cross-chunk block writes): now holds an exclusive shard lock across the read-check-write instead of two separate locked operations.
- Fixed a use-after-free: neighbor chunks are now pinned (via `pending_mesh_builds` atomic) during mesh build so they can't be unloaded mid-build.
- **Unified block definitions into a single JSON source of truth** (`data/block_definitions.json`): `BlockRegistry::load_from_json` replaces scattered per-block C++ definitions; texture/emissive arrays are generated from the same file.
- **Added emissive texture support**: a second `Texture2DArray` for per-face glow maps, sourced from `data/block_definitions.json`, threaded through `mesh_builder_faces.cpp` and `material_manager.cpp`.
- **Added vegetation generation**: tree placement with minimum spacing between trunks, deferred cross-chunk writes to the main thread to avoid shard-lock contention, exposed as a `vegetation_enabled` inspector toggle. Fixed a greedy-mesh vertex winding bug (CW vs CCW) and an AO flip condition discovered while re-enabling it.
- **Disabled the sun's shadow map**: both terrain shaders are unshaded, so the shadow pass was pure GPU cost with no visible effect.
- Fixed godray shader white-tint and crosshair rendering artifacts; removed unused textures.
- Added far-region chunk merging, deferred auto-update, and unload notification to reduce redundant work when regions are only partially cached.

**Repo hygiene / process (most recent):**
- Removed a committed Windows `.lnk` shortcut (`src/fuk-minecraft.lnk`) that leaked a local filesystem path; scrubbed it from git history (not just HEAD) via a history rewrite, then force-pushed. Added `*.lnk` to `.gitignore`.
- Removed a stray empty file (`s`) and three orphaned Godot `.obj.import` files (`RealSkeleton.obj.import` and two `tools/*.obj.import` files pointing at build binaries, not real assets). Added `/s` and `*.import` to `.gitignore`.
- Added a `LICENSE` file (GPL-3.0) — the repo had none before, meaning it was technically all-rights-reserved despite being public.
- Added CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): cross-platform matrix (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest), SCons build + test on every push/PR, TSan on Linux via `TSAN=1` flag, `tsan_suppressions.txt` for doctest/godot-cpp noise, timeouts on all steps. Added ASan+UBSan leg on ubuntu.

**Light-propagation lock fixes (7 deadlock classes, all resolved):**
- Discovered that `lock_all()` returns `ShardLock` (shared_lock) but write paths in light propagation assumed mutual exclusion. Identified 5 deadlock classes (A–E) in the locking hierarchy.
- **Deadlock A**: `process_completed_chunks:142` held `lock_all()` shared → else-branch called `propagate_block_light_region` → tried `lock_all_exclusive()` → shared→exclusive upgrade fails.
- **Deadlocks B–D**: `propagate_block_light_region`, `light_propagate_add`, `light_propagate_remove` held `lock_all_exclusive()` → called `mark_chunks_dirty_for_light` → `get_chunk_render_data()` → shared_lock on same shards → self-deadlock. Fixed by moving `mark_chunks_dirty_for_light` calls outside the lock scope in all public wrappers.
- **Deadlock E**: `block_editor.cpp:place_block` — unlocked `set_block` writes to ChunkData while mesh builders read under shared shard locks. Fixed by wrapping all ChunkData reads/writes in `lock_all_exclusive()`, using `_fast` accessors, calling `_locked` light variant, then releasing lock before auto-locking operations (mark_dirty, queue_dirty_chunk).
- **Deadlock F (naming trap)**: `update_block_light_incremental_locked` acquired its own `lock_all_exclusive()` despite the `_locked` naming convention meaning "caller already holds lock". If `place_block` had called it from inside its own lock scope, same self-deadlock. Fixed by moving the lock acquisition to the public wrapper, making `_locked` truly lock-free.
- **Bug G**: `player_light.hpp` lines 70/91 wrote `set_light_rgb` without any lock while light propagation BFS could run concurrently on worker threads. Fixed by adding `ChunkMap&` parameter to `update()`, acquiring `lock_all_exclusive()` for all ChunkData operations, binding BFS callbacks to public `_locked` methods, and deferring `mark_dirty` calls to after lock release.
- `pending_light_removals_` protected with `std::mutex` — narrow scope in `try_fixup_chunk` (find/erase only, release before calling `propagate_block_light_region`).
- Added `lock_all_exclusive()` to `ChunkMap` (returns `ExclusiveShardLock` with `std::unique_lock`).
- Public `_locked` BFS methods (`light_propagate_add_locked`, `light_propagate_remove_locked`, `update_block_light_incremental_locked`) moved to public — contract documented: caller MUST already hold `lock_all_exclusive()`, uses `_fast` accessors only, MUST NOT call `mark_chunks_dirty_for_light`.

**Targeted shard locking (`lock_keys_exclusive`) — fully migrated:**
- Added `lock_keys_exclusive<N>()` to `ChunkMap` — returns `ExclusiveShardLock` on only the shards whose keys appear in the input, in ascending shard order (deadlock-safe). Template and vector overloads.
- Migrated ALL hot paths from `lock_all_exclusive()` (all 64 shards) to `lock_keys_exclusive()`:
  - `set_block_variant()` — 1 chunk key
  - `propagate_block_light_region()` — 27 keys (3×3×3 neighborhood)
  - `fire_and_forget` lambda in `chunk_world.cpp` — 27 keys (3×3×3 neighborhood)
  - `update()` outer scope in `chunk_world.cpp` — 28 keys (1 center + 3×3×3 neighbors)
  - `place_block` (block_editor.cpp) — 27 keys (3×3×3 center)
  - `light_propagate_add` — origin 3×3×3 + each seed node's 3×3×3, deduplicated via `seen[]`
  - `light_propagate_remove` — same pattern as add
  - `update_block_light_incremental` — 54 keys (origin + center 3×3×3)
  - `PlayerLight::update` — vector of up to 54 keys (old+new chunk 3×3×3)
- BFS bounded reach: max light level 15 < chunk size 32, so 3×3×3 neighborhood (27 keys) covers all BFS paths from a single seed chunk.

**Concurrency tests and cross-platform CI:**
- 16 concurrency regression tests in `tests/test_concurrency.cpp` using `TestShardMap` (mirrors ChunkMap's 64-shard architecture without needing `godot::RID`). Covers: shard lock concurrency, ascending-order deadlock prevention, exclusive serialization, PaletteStorage R/W, `pending_light_removals_` pattern, RAII lock correctness, `OrderedExclusiveShardLock` target verification, light removal tests, cross-chunk writer race tests, and `pending_light_removals_` stress test.
- 102 tests / 525 assertions total across 11 test files.
- CI: cross-platform matrix with 4 legs — ubuntu TSan, ubuntu ASan+UBSan, ubuntu plain, macos plain, windows plain. Benchmark runs on non-sanitizer legs with `--check` regression detection.

**Expanded benchmark tool:**
- `tools/benchmark.cpp` benchmarks four hot paths: `generate_chunk` (1,000 iters), `build_mesh` (1,000 iters), `palette_write` (100 full-chunk fills), and `light_propagation` (1,000 iters on 3×3×3 grid with emissive source).
- `benchmark_baseline.txt` checked into repo with 2× measured values as regression thresholds.
- `--check <baseline>` mode exits non-zero on regression; wired into CI.
- `LightPropagation` TimerID added to `performance_timer.hpp`.

**Save format versioning (chunk persistence):**
- Chunk files bumped from v2 to v3: header now includes a CRC32 checksum of the RLE body.
- Format: `[width:u32][height:u32][depth:u32][version:u32=3][crc32:u32][RLE body...]`.
- `load_chunk_from_disk` handles v3 (CRC32 verified), v2 (legacy RLE, no check), and v1 (flat, legacy) transparently.
- Corrupted v3 files are rejected at load time (returns `false`).
- `crc32.hpp` is a header-only IEEE 802.3 CRC32 implementation in `src/core/`.

**Sanitizer/fuzz infrastructure:**
- Added `ASAN=1` build flag to SConstruct (ASan+UBSan, Linux/Clang only, mirrors TSan pattern).
- Added ASan+UBSan CI leg on ubuntu-latest with `halt_on_error=1` and `detect_leaks=1`.
- Added libFuzzer harnesses (Linux/Clang only, `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined`):
  - `tools/fuzz_palette.cpp` — random set/get on `ChunkData`
  - `tools/fuzz_chunk_load.cpp` — random `ChunkData` header parsing
- Built via `scons fuzz` target.

### Blocked
- (none)

## Key Decisions
- Use `Camera3D::get_frustum()` for direct 6-plane extraction in world space; frustum recalculated every frame.
- Two-phase generation: dedicated frustum-priority pass first, then distance-sorted sweep.
- Collision uses the original binary-search approach (a DDA approach was tried and reverted).
- Sharded locking: 64 shards, per-shard `unordered_map` + `shared_mutex`, hash is `key % 64`. Hot paths doing many sequential reads (light propagation, dirty-neighbor checks) batch-lock instead of locking per call.
- Palette sections are 16³ (8 per chunk), matching `dirty_subchunks`; block and light storage share the same generic `PalSection`/`section_get`/`section_set` machinery.
- Greedy mesher reads through `get_block_unsafe()`/`get_light_packed_word_unsafe()` rather than raw pointers or thread-local shared buffers.
- Thread pool stays a single shared pool (not split into separate gen/mesh pools) — a split was tried and reverted after it starved generation throughput ~7×; a high-priority queue path handles contention instead.
- **LOD approach**: after removing the group-merge system, the project settled on per-chunk distance-based stride/detail reduction (`lod_distance`/`lod_detail_level`) rather than re-introducing chunk merging — simpler to reason about and to keep correct at boundaries, at the cost of not reducing draw-call count the way merged groups did.
- **Block definitions are data, not code**: `data/block_definitions.json` is the only place block properties/textures/emissive maps are defined; C++ and the texture-array generator both read from it.
- Solid-block fast paths in the mesher require zeroing `solid_cache` at the start of every build — stale `BlockID`s from a reused thread-local builder previously caused wrong registry lookups in all-air sections.
- **Locking hierarchy for ChunkData writes**: all ChunkData reads/writes must hold `lock_all_exclusive()` or `lock_keys_exclusive()` for targeted shards. Public `_locked` BFS methods use `_fast` accessors under that lock. Auto-locking accessors (`get_chunk_data`, `get_chunk_render_data`, `mark_chunks_dirty_for_light`, `queue_dirty_chunk`) acquire their own shared locks — they MUST NOT be called under an exclusive lock. Public wrappers: acquire exclusive lock → call `_locked` → release lock → call auto-locking accessors for dirty-marking.

## Next Steps
- Expand automated test coverage further: the `tests/` suite now has 102 test cases / 525 assertions covering palette storage, mesh culling, greedy mesher, LOD, neighbor accessor, face emission, concurrency (shard locking, exclusive serialization, PaletteStorage R/W, cross-chunk writer races, light removal), but edge cases in light propagation BFS paths across chunk boundaries still lack regression tests.
- No gameplay layer exists yet beyond block break/place (no inventory, crafting, mobs, multiplayer); `player.gd` remains an explicit temporary placeholder pending a C++ player controller.
- Expand fuzz coverage: harness for `propagate_chunk_block_light_additive`, harness for `build_mesh` with random block layouts.

## Critical Context
- Chunk size is 32×32×32 (`CHUNK_WIDTH`/`CHUNK_HEIGHT`/`CHUNK_DEPTH` in `chunk_coords.hpp`), world height 1024 (`WORLD_HEIGHT_Y`).
- `Camera3D::get_frustum()` returns `TypedArray<Plane>` (6 planes, world-space, normals pointing inward), recalculated every frame.
- Generator `insert` locks only one shard — doesn't block readers on other shards.
- Block + light memory per chunk: dense layout was ~130KB; paletted layout is ~1–20KB on typical (uniform-heavy) terrain.
- `data/block_definitions.json` is the single source of truth for block properties, per-face textures, and emissive maps — do not hardcode block properties in C++.
- The old merged-mesh LOD system is gone; the current LOD system is stride/detail-based inside the greedy mesher, controlled by `lod_distance`/`lod_detail_level`.
- CI runs on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): 4 legs — ubuntu TSan, ubuntu ASan+UBSan, ubuntu plain, macos plain, windows plain. Benchmark with `--check` on non-sanitizer legs.
- Light propagation: `propagate_chunk_block_light_additive` is additive-only (single-chunk, no ChunkMap needed). Multi-chunk BFS requires `LightPropagator` + ChunkMap. To simulate removal, call `clear_light()` before re-propagating.
- BFS bounded reach: max light level 15 < chunk size 32, so `lock_keys_exclusive` with 3×3×3 neighborhoods (27 keys) covers all BFS paths from a single seed chunk.
